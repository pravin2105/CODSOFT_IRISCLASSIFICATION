# CODSOFT_IRISCLASSIFICATION

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on the classification of iris flowers. The famous Iris dataset, introduced by biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, is used for this analysis. The dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

The primary goal of this project is to explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, build a classification model, and evaluate its performance in predicting the iris species based on the provided features.
